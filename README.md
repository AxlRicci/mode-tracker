## How To Use

The application can be used as an anonymous user or by creating an account. 

The user will navigate to the survey page where they will select the school and grade for the survey. Then they will poll their class to record how many students biked, walked, rolled, took the schoolbus, public transit, or a car to get to school. The results will be added to the database and summary statistics for the survey will be shown. Additionally, the survey will be posted to the school's page and the school's summary statistics updated.

If a user has registered by email or Google account, they will have the ability to edit and delete the surveys they have completed.
